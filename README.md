### Download [apk](https://github.com/Coder481/KotlinRoom/releases/download/v1.0/app-debug.apk) for testing offline data storage
#### Room is a perfect solution when it's all about storing data offline. <br/> Room is an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for mapping our database objects with models in android. It is part of the Architecture Components.

## Components of RoomDB
- [**Entity**](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/room/Entity) - A class that describes a database table when working with Room
- [**DAO**](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/room/Dao.html) (Data Access Object) - A mapper of SQL queries to functions
- **Database** - For on device storage
- **Repository** - Primarily used to manage multiple data sources
- [**ViewModel**](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Communication centre between data and UI
